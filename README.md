# Solution to trustpilot pony challenge 
(Not quite finished yet)
I'm still working on a minimap/compass showing the pony's, the exit and domokun's location in the maze.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

The UI shows the trapped pony it's  current location and possible move directions.

# File content

- App.js the main applikation and state storage.

- Statusbar is responsible for rendering the location of the pony, domokun and the exit.

- RelativePosition.js is where the pony's location is compared with the exit and Domokun. 

- ponyMoves is responsible for posting pony moves, and showing the pony's available move directions.
